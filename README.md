# Overview

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of functional programming by implementing a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game in Erlang. As a programmer, I aim to learn how to write modular, recursive, and efficient code using a functional paradigm. This project also allowed me to explore the unique syntax and features of Erlang while applying practical programming techniques. 

The software is a text-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players alternate turns to place their marks on a 3x3 grid. The program determines win conditions, detects draws, and handles invalid moves while adhering to Erlang's principles of immutability and recursion. The game uses lists and pattern matching extensively to maintain the board state and implement the game logic.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice functional programming concepts, become familiar with Erlang syntax, and learn how to develop interactive applications in a declarative style.

# Development Environment

The development environment consisted of:
- **Operating System**: Linux/Windows/Mac (specify your system)
- **Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code with Erlang plugin
- **Erlang Version**: Erlang/OTP 25
- **Tools**: Terminal for compiling and running the code

The programming language used was **Erlang**, and no external libraries were required, as the project relied on core Erlang features.

# Future Work

* Add a feature for a single-player mode with an AI opponent.
* Improve input validation to handle edge cases more robustly.
* Enhance the display for a clearer and more visually appealing output.
* Refactor the code for better modularity and readability by separating utility functions into additional modules.
